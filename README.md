# Odin Recipes
The goal of this project is to create a basic HTML recipe website.

I will create it with skills that I learned following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/):
- Working with basic commands in the terminal on Xubuntu
- Working with VS Code
- Organizing my project file system
- Creating .html files including boilerplates
- Applying basic formatting to .html files
- Inserting links in .html files
- Inserting images in .html files
